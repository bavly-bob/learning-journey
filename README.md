# Learning Journey & Projects

This repository documents my programming learning journey and applied projects,
with a primary focus on C++ and system-level problem solving.

## Structure
- `learning/` — language fundamentals, problem solving, and experiments
- `projects/` — complete, real-world systems built using OOP and file-based persistence

## Main Focus Areas
- C++ (OOP, STL, file I/O)
- Problem solving (LeetCode, Codeforces, Codewars)
- Software design and modular architecture

This repository is continuously updated as I learn and improve.
