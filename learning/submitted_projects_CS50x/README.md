## About This Repository
This repository contains my solutions and projects from **CS50x: Introduction to Computer Science**, Harvard University's entry-level computer science course. CS50x helped me develop fundamental programming skills, problem-solving abilities, and a strong foundation in algorithms, data structures, and web development.

Throughout this course, I tackled challenging assignments in **C, Python, SQL, and web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)**, which strengthened both my logical thinking and coding proficiency.

## Projects Overview
Each folder in this repository corresponds to a CS50x project or assignment. Below is a brief description of some of the key projects:

- **Hello** – Introduction to C programming and command-line basics.  
- **Mario** – Implemented pyramid patterns using loops, learning control structures.  
- **Cash** – Built a program to calculate minimum coins for change, practicing conditionals and arithmetic logic.  
- **Credit** – Validated credit card numbers using Luhn’s algorithm, focusing on algorithm implementation and modular arithmetic.  
- **Plurality / Runoff / Tideman** – Created election systems to understand arrays, structs, and algorithmic problem solving.  
- **DNA** – Implemented sequence matching algorithms to analyze genetic data.  
- **Finance** – Built a simple web application for stock trading using Python Flask, SQL, and APIs.
